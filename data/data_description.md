## Description

On January 21, 2016, the French Court of Auditors published a report on public policies to combat air pollution. This report was requested by the Evaluation and Oversight Committee for Public Policies of the National Assembly, in accordance with Article 132-5 of the Code of Financial Jurisdictions.

The Court found that there is no clearly structured policy on this matter in France. Instead, there exists a patchwork of heterogeneous measures, mostly applications of European directives. Some initiatives have had significant impacts, such as the air quality monitoring system and the reduction of industrial pollutant emissions.

However, with the exception of the industrial and energy production sectors, the "polluter pays" principle is not appliedâ€”particularly in the agricultural and residential-tertiary sectors. Furthermore, the principle of subsidiarity is not fully respected, which undermines the effectiveness of the various actions taken.

National-level interventions have also disrupted local initiatives and, in some cases, delayed or limited the implementation of effective tools.

The Court concludes that combating air pollution requires much stronger involvement from all economic actors, including individuals. It issues 12 recommendations.
